This involves coefficient fitting using MATLAB scripts.

"Data processing" refers to the actual spectral data obtained from spectrometer measurements.

The coefficients mentioned in the model are those obtained by fitting the actual spectral data in Origin.

"D-numbers" represent the peak wavelength fitting results at different milliampere (mA) settings.

"Fit" denotes the results derived from correlation coefficient fitting.
